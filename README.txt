# Assignment2

You must run this program as root.
In a linux terminal run the program like so:
    
    sudo python Assignment2.py <path to shadow file> <username>
    
    EXAMPLE:
    
    sudo python Assignment2.py /etc/shadow testuser
    
The ONLY output from the program will be the successful password or a failure message.
This uses the ubuntu dictionary file that was used in the first lab. (For quick results, choose a word starting with a capital 'A' or 'B'. (I used the password "Adolf" and "Amazon" to test it.)
